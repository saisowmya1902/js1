<h3><b><u>Welcome to JavaScript</u></b></h3>
<p style="color: darkblue;">JavaScript is often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, 
alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior</p>
<p style="color: darkgreen;">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
 It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming 
interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
<p style="color: black;">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics 
facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
greatly in design.</p>
